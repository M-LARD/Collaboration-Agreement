### Conflict Plan

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
> Try to resolve the conflict as a group, if that doesn't work we will loop in the instructor
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
> Attempt to discuss it as a group.  Try to mitigate via assigning certain tasks to people.  Ongoing communication as a group.
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
> Having patience and ensure a safe space to ask questions
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
> Assigning tasks and articulating what needs to be done and being in constant communication checking in with each other.
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
> Hexx or other Code Fellows staff (Joey)
